class SharedCounter(object):
        """ A synchronized shared counter.

        The locking done by multiprocessing.Value ensures that only a single
        process or thread may read or write the in-memory ctypes object. However,
        in order to do n += 1, Python performs a read followed by a write, so a
        second process may read the old value before the new one is written by the
        first process. The solution is to use a multiprocessing.Lock to guarantee
        the atomicity of the modifications to Value.

        This class comes almost entirely from Eli Bendersky's blog:

class Queue(multiprocessing.queues.Queue):
        '''
        A portable implementation of multiprocessing.Queue.

        Because of multithreading / multiprocessing semantics, Queue.qsize() may
        raise the NotImplementedError exception on Unix platforms like Mac OS X
        where sem_getvalue() is not implemented. This subclass addresses this
        problem by using a synchronized shared counter (initialized to zero) and
        increasing / decreasing its value every time the put() and get() methods
        are called, respectively. This not only prevents NotImplementedError from
        being raised, but also allows us to implement a reliable version of both
        qsize() and empty()
