Pool-HMM
========

[Pool-HMM](https://qgsp.jouy.inra.fr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=56&Itemid=63)
is a program to estimate allele frequencies and detecting selective sweeps in NGS pools described 
in [Boitard _et al._ 2012](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/9/2177.long) and implemented 
in [Boitard _et al._ 2013](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1755-0998.12063/abstract). See more information
in the [program README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lczech/PoolHMM/master/README.txt).

This repository contains the code downloaded from [here](https://forge-dga.jouy.inra.fr/projects/pool-hmm),
forked from [here](https://github.com/magicDGS/PoolHMM),
which includes a few modifications for support parallelization in MacOS computers and more features. 
See there for details. On top of the modifications made there, we here simply fix some Python indentation issues,
as well as add back the test files feor completeness.
